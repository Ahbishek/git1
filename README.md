# Anamoly Detection in logs
#AIM: 
  Anomaly detection in logs - Explore recurrent neural networks for log content analysis. 
  
  
  
#TASK achieved :         
  1)      Created blocks of text representations using features 
           Bigrams, timestamp statistics, word counts, paragraph vectors. 

  2)      Created time series form of vector sequences 

  3)      Trained RNN and predict the next sequence. 

  4)      Based on prediction, detect anomalies. 
  
#How to Run :- 

FOR USER:
1) python finaltest.py   
2) Start server in browser.   
3)Future Predicitons :- Enter number of future predicions
4)Specify the file to test


FOR DEVELOPER
1)python finaltrain.py :
2)Start server in browser
3)Specify the  required training file.
4)page_impression.csv  :-  contents date and time (  used only in graph plotting purpose)
			       max-size of data to be tested is determined by the number of rows in this 			       file
